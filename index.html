                    <p>My name is Andrew Zajac, and I live in Barnesville, MN. I have been working as a CNA at Valley Care and Rehab for almost three years.

                    <p>I graduated with a 3.7 GPA, classifying me as an honor student for the Class of 2023.</p>
                    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                    <h3>Valley Care and Rehab-CNA</h3>
                    <p>March 25th, 2021-present</p>
                    <p>I help assist the residents who live in the nursing home with everyday things that they can no longer do themselves. </p>
                    <h2>Skills</h2>
                    <p>HTML: All the skills that I know I learned from the courses EDA so greatly provides. Including the use of links and Flexbox has made me a better coder.</p>
                    <p>CSS: Similar to HTML, I learned CSS from the courses I took with EDA. Like changing color, shape, height, and length for example.</p>
                    <p>Word: I have needed to use Word for my Senior year. I know how to utilize the majority of what Word has to offer.</p>
                    <p>Tech: One of the reasons why I put Word up there was just to show that I do use and know quite a bit about technology. It is something that I use every day and if there is a problem with the tech, I strive to problem-solve and find the issue.</p>
