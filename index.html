                    <h2>Skills</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML: All the skills that I know I learned from the courses EDA so greatly provides. Including the use of links and Flexbox has made me a better coder.</li>
                        <li>CSS: Similar to HTML, I learned CSS from the courses I took with EDA. Like changing color, shape, height, and length for example.</li>
                        <li>Word: I have needed to use Word for my Senior year. I know how to utilize the majority of what Word has to offer.</li>
                        <li>Tech: One of the reasons why I put Word up there was just to show that I do use and know quite a bit about technology. It is something that I use every day and if there is a problem with the tech, I strive to problem-solve and find the issue.</li>
